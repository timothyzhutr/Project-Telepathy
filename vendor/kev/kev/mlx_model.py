"""Apple Silicon backend for the Qwen3.5 checkpoints: mlx-lm's Metal implementation of the hybrid backbone under Kev's
own encoder and pointer head.

MPS has no Gated DeltaNet kernels, so the PyTorch path runs reference code there (Kev-4B ~0.8 s per request). This module
runs the same computation on Metal through mlx-lm and keeps everything Kev-specific unchanged: `kev.model.encode` builds the
tokens, `rows_of` splits them into one causal row per question (the hybrid form the torch path uses too), and the readout is
the very same `PointerHead` (fp32, with the checkpoint's temperature) applied to the branch hidden states.

Same contract as `DecisionModel` for serving and scoring: encode / forward / probs / probs_and_prefix / probs_with_prefix /
head / dtype. Selected by `LoadOptions(backend="mlx")` (or "auto" on Apple Silicon) in `kev.checkpoint`; never by the
benchmark, whose reported numbers stay on the fp32 torch path. Parity against that path is measured in
tests/test_mlx.py (max |dp| and argmax flips on development records, prefix vs full pass, one question vs several).

Two ways in, both through kev.checkpoint: a LoRA checkpoint is its base's mlx-lm model (`load_base`) with the adapter
folded in (`merge_lora`); a full-weight checkpoint (kev.train --full_ft, scripts/merge_lora_checkpoint.py) is built from its
own config.json and shards (`load_full`), nothing merged, so the only resident copy is the weights themselves.
